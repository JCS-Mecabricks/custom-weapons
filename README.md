 There is the Block of Silver crafted from silver. Next there is the Scythe, Spear, and Sickles which are weapons.
 Sickles are crafted from the sickle so the sickle doesn't do any damage but Sickles do damage. After that there is Silver which can naturally be found in deepslate and stone.
 Then There is the Spartan Helm, Chestplate, Medieval Leggings, and Boots. They do a decent amount of protection.

 Here are the recipes:

My enchanted book bolting isn't on the tab but what it does is that it strikes mobs and players with lightning.
